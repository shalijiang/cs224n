4/16/2019 6:48:26	Sirui Li	4/15 #1: Sudarshan Rajagopal, Zayid Oyelami	5: perfectly appropriate	4	5: very effective	The presentation gives a very detailed explanation of the problem setup and the dataset that they used. The experiment is a comparison between Bayesian/frequentist linear regression. A downside is that they didn't spend very much time talking about the experimental result, but is understandable considering that they are the first group presenting.	4.666666667
4/16/2019 6:51:19	Sirui Li	4/15 #2: Daniel Teich, Ria Das	5: perfectly appropriate	5: very thorough	5: very effective	They showed a pretty detailed comparison between BART and conventional random forest. I think the presentation is very good overall. The comparison is mostly about the MSE difference, so more Bayesian methods for the final report would be appreciated.	5
4/16/2019 7:21:22	Sirui Li	4/15 #6: Ting Liu	4	4	4	The presenter claims that he claims 100% accuracy on image classification of 4 types of cars if he takes the CNN feature and adds a GP layer at the end. Although the result seems very good, I feel like (1) the work/effort he put into this project is not very substantial, as all he needs to do is to train a GP classifier for the feature extracted by CNN, and (2) he claims that there's nothing to improve as there is already 100% accuracy, but I feel like it is due to the 4 type of class labels he chose are too easy to separate. I hope he can choose to more and harder labels for the classification to see if he can get improvement by replacing the softmax CNN classification layer with a GP.	4
4/16/2019 7:23:12	Sirui Li	4/15 #5: Ben Choi	5: perfectly appropriate	5: very thorough	5: very effective	I think the presentation (about  FIFA 19 prediction) is very good overall. Very good pace of the presentation with a detailed introduction to the problem setup, dataset, and method he used. The result also looks pretty good.	5
4/16/2019 7:24:57	Sirui Li	4/15 #4: Yang Jin	5: perfectly appropriate	4	4	One suggestion is that it would be much better if he speaks up a bit/becomes more energetic. He uses GP regression to do the prediction of New York City Tax Fare. One thing I'm not sure about is that the Manhattan distance feature he adds to the classification makes the problem to easy (since there seems to be a clear linear trend between distance and tax fare). However, it seems that he did a reasonable amount of work overall for his project.	4.333333333
4/16/2019 7:29:55	Sirui Li	4/15 #3: Chang Liu	5: perfectly appropriate	5: very thorough	4	The presenter talked about using a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to predict Football scores. I think he did a reasonable amount of work for his project, although I think he needs a bit more work to explore the Naive Bayes algorithm he used (for example, see if it can give him uncertainty instead of just point estimation)	4.666666667

In the presentation of the results, it's important that everybody can understand them and potentially take their own conclusion (which hopefully is the same as yours). Always remember to have labels, titles and all the relevant information on charts and pictures such that the viewer can understand it by itself (if she/he has the relevant background)	4
